# Spring Boot Movie Mashup

## Introduction
A Movie Mashup application that I use to play around with [Spring](https://spring.io/) related technologies.

## What does it do?
Given the name of a movie this application looks up a set of recommended movies from [TasteDive](https://tastedive.com/). For each movie it then looks up the [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) rating from [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

And yes, this is one of the assignments of the [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) course on Coursera. It is a nice assignment to try out in Java and Spring.
